"""
Minimum Spanning Tree


Kruskal's algorithm implementation.

Input:
    weight_by_edge: A dict of the form {(u, v): weight} for every undirected graph edge {u, v}

Precondition:
    The input graph is connected

Output:
    A set of edges that connects all the vertices of the input graph and has the least possible total weight.

Example:
    >>> minimum_spanning_tree({
    ...     (1, 2): 10,
    ...     (2, 3): 15,
    ...     (3, 4): 10,
    ...     (1, 4): 10
    ... })
    {(1, 2), (3, 4), (1, 4)}
